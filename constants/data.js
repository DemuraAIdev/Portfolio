      `I am a website developer, bot, graphic designer, and nft artist. I learned to make a website from 2019 at that time I learned basic html after 3 months I learned PHP to make my own framework but failed, at that time I found a chat platform called discord I looked for friends to help me but no one uses php they use nodejs , at that time 2020 i know nodejs`,
      `in 2020 I tried to make a discord bot called INTI and I continue to learn and make another bot called DotBot. At that time I met a friend with the username Zeck and he invited me to create an anime fanspage called Cinta Anime.ID there were admins named Ray, Knightio, Leonz, Zeck, and I`,
